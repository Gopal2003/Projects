These file contains the helper classes which are used in this project.


1. CurrentUserId.java - This file a singleton class. The object of this class contains a variable which contain the current user's login id. Every time the user login, the id of the current user id is initialized in the variable CurrentUserId of the instance of this class. The reason behind using the singleton class is, I wanted a way through which I can retrive the current user id in any .java file and hence, as singleton class contain only one object, I can get the current user id.


2.UserValidation.java - I used this class in LoginService.java file as the user validation. This class contains two properties of type boolean and one of type Login. The first boolean property is usernameverification which is used to check whether the username typed by used exists in database or not. The second boolean property is passwordVerification which has the same functionality as usernameverification. The use of the third property is to set the currentLogged - in user's id in the CurrentUserId class. The benefit of setting the id is, whenever we add a contact, the contact will be added to the current logged - in user's account and hence we can only fetch the contact details of the user when the user is logged-in.
