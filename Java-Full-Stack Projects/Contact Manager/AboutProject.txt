This project is designed is such a way that a user can store his/her contact details by logging in using username and password.

As this project only contais the backend part which is still incomplete(with respect to frontend). I designed so that one can test the backend using postman app. I covered every aspect and maybe their might be few test cases where my code lags behind. I will design the frontend and improve the backend code with additional functionality like password hashing in furture as this will take me many days and efforts.
